This document describes our team social contract for this project

Mentor: Jessica Duell
Team:
-Wonjun Jung
-Matthew Giambrone
-Ana Otero

Roles:

Task master: Ana
Git master: Wonjun
Test master: Matthew

Daily Process

Start with a group standup (less than 15 mins total)
Task master facilitates and calls on each person for an update
Each person says what they've worked on, what they accomplished since last standup and any blockers they have encountered
At the end of each standup we rotate the roles
Begin to work on assigned tasks for that day (making sure to pull in changes from previous merges)
bring up questions or issues in our team slack channel after 20 mins of being blocked by one issue
When a task is complete we make a PR and have at least one other member review and approve before merging.
The PR must be approved and pass CircleCi tests before it can merge

Team Expectations

Each of us reserves the rights to our weekends and we have been straightforward with how and when we can commit to working on the project
If we have a blocking issue, we will post a slack message to the team before DMing one person
None of us will specialize in front-end or back-end code
Don't interrupt - raise your hand
We will allow space for everyone to speak
Discuss when we disagree - argue infrequently
We will message the group when we change what task we are working on
We will use a board of cards to show what issues are being worked on and what issues need to be done

MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT

1. User will be able to register
2. User will be able to see and update their profile
3. User be able to write a post that will be rendered on their profile
4. Every user will have a feed/dashboard page where they can see other user and their recent posts

Stretch Goals

Issues
If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:

Take 5 - 10 min break
List out the pros / cons
Vote on it
If the vote is split, escalate to our mentor or instructor
If we are frustrated:

We will take a walk or get some water
Talk constructively about actionable items
Bring in a 3rd party to mediate
